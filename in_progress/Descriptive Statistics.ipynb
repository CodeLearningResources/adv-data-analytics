    "Inferential statistics: uses statistics to make predictions.\n",
    "Descriptive statistics just describes data. For example, descriptive statistics about a college could include: the average SAT score for incoming freshmen; the median income of parents; racial makeup of the student body. It says nothing about why the data might exist, or what trends you might be able to see from the data. When you take your data and start to make predictions about future behavior or trends, that’s inferential statistics. Inferential statistics also allows you to take sample data (e.g. from one university) and apply it to a larger population (e.g. all universities in the country)."
